## Python Automation using Selenium &amp; Scheduling of messages and media

## Objective:
Pywhatsapp is used to Automate Whatsapp through Whatsapp web. We can
add number of contacts whom we want to send messages or Media
attachments ( like Video or Images). Selenium, Autoit and Schedule have
been used one from Automation and other for Scheduling messages.

---

## Use Case:
We can schedule Good Morning or Good night messages with a nice Picture
at a particular time to our loved ones. We can set reminders. Suppose at
12 o'clock you want to wish your friend happy birthday so schedule your
messages and sleep peacefully.

## Installation

>$ pip install -r requirements.txt

OR

>$ pip install selenium
>
>$ pip install schedule
>
>$ pip install PyAutoIt

###### NOTE: If there is any issue in installation of pyautoit then clone the repo and install from repo. [LINK](https://github.com/jacexh/pyautoit)

## Feature Enhancement: 
QR CODE Scanning: On receiving a lot of complaints about QR Code Scanning Issue again and again. I have added a Cookie system that will save your session so that whatsapp don't think you are login for first time. By Saving Session data you will have to scan QR Code to Login only once or till the time whatsapp doesnot log you out from whatsappweb.

NOTE: A folder User_Data will be created which has all your session information. Keep this Folder VERY SAFE. 

## Code:
### Added ArgParser
`python3 PyWhatsapp.py --help`<br>
  --chrome_driver_path (required) CHROME_DRIVER_PATH chromedriver executable path (MAC and Windows path would be different) <br>
  --message (optional) MESSAGE Enter the msg you want to send <br>
  --remove_cache (optional) REMOVE_CACHE Remove Cache | Scan QR again or Not <br>
  --import_contact (optional) IMPORT_CONTACT reads contacts from contact.txt text file <br>
  --enable_headless (optional) Enable Headless Driver (True/False)<br>

For Windows: `python3 PyWhatsapp.py --message 'Hi Shaurya, How Are you?'`
<br>For MACOS: `python3 PyWhatsapp.py --message 'Hi Shaurya, How Are you?'`

inorder to check it is working perfectly.
